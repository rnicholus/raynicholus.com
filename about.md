My name is Ray Nicholus, and I'm currently a Web Developer working for
[Widen](http://www.widen.com), an awesome marketing technology software company in
Madison, Wisconsin, USA.  I'm also the lead developer and product manager of [Fine Uploader](http://fineuploader.com/).
I like to write, blog, and [talk about software](http://slides.com/raynicholus)
in my free time. I'm also currently in the process of writing a book named [Beyond jQuery](https://leanpub.com/beyondjquery).
